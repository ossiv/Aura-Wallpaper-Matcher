# Aura-Wallpaper-Matcher
A program using the Asus Aura SDK to match motherboard LED lights to the current Windows wallpaper.

Includes a partial C# wrapper for the Asus Aura SDK, and a Windows program that uses the SDK for the color matching part.

This project is quite specific to my machine, but is provided here as perhaps a starting point for other people who want to use the Aura SDK with C# in their own projects.
